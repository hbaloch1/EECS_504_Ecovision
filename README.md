# Ecovision

1. What is your team name? Who is on the team?
Team Name: EcoVision, Kody Takada, Haider Baloch, Daniel Shim

2. What is your project name?
EcoVision 

3. What is your project description (4–6 sentences)?

EcoVision is a computer vision based project aimed at monitoring and identifying deforestation and pollution. Our approach involves analyzing satellite imagery to detect changes in forest cover and identify areas of environmental degradation. By utilizing images as graphs and points, we aim to identify patterns and indicators of deforestation and pollution with high accuracy. Our overall goal with this project is to aid the preservation of natural habitats and promote sustainable environmental practices.

4. What do you expect to be able to demonstrate for your project by the end of the term?
We expect to present one of these detections working by the end of the term

By the end of the term, we expect to demonstrate a functional prototype capable of either detecting signs of deforestation or identifying pollution indicators in selected areas. This prototype will showcase our ability to process and analyze satellite images, applying computer vision techniques discussed over the semester to extract meaningful feature points from the data.


5. What is the potential positive impact to society your project may enable?

By aiding in the detection of illegal deforestation activities, our project can serve as a valuable tool for environmental protection agencies and conservationists. This could lead to more effective enforcement of environmental laws and policies, helping to preserve the environment and reduce the adverse effects of deforestation, such as biodiversity loss and climate change. Additionally, our project can raise awareness about the ongoing environmental challenges and encourage a more sustainable interaction with our planet’s natural resources.
